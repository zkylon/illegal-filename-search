# illegal-filename-search
Real simple Unity-made searcher to find tricky files that are screwing with your commits. I made this quickly for my own use and only tested it on Windows, and so it's provided as-is with no support. 

It's likely to work better on folders with thousands of files as opposed to millions, so probably don't run this on C:/ !!

Uses UnityStandaloneFileBrowser: https://github.com/gkngkc/UnityStandaloneFileBrowser (requires .NET 4.0)
